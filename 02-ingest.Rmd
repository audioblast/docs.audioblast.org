# audioBlastIngest
The ingest tools are used to discover recordings or other bioacoustic data published by third parties and bring them into the audioBlast system. Creating an ingest task is a simple three step process.

1. Third party publishes data online.

2. audioBlast team work with third party to create an API module to map the published data on to audioBlast data structures.

3. The audioBlastIngest package handles the import of the data.

Once the data is imported the audio files can be analysed on audioBlast infrastructure if required.

Updates without changes to the incoming data structure are handled periodically by the ingest server.
