# audioBlastIngest
The ingest service is responsible for bringing data about recordings, deployments, annotation, taxa and traits into the audioBlast system. Data sources are specified as modules within the audioBlast API, which give details of each data source and the processing that is expected to be performed by the ingest process. The ingest process itself is managed on audioBlast infrastructure by the audioBlastIngest package. This package obtains data from the sources specified in the API modules, performs and requested transformations, and loads the data into the audioBlast database.

Note: The database generates analysis tasks using triggers as data is inserted or updated, however the analyses are performed by a separate processes to the ingest.
