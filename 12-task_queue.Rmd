# The Task Queue System
The Task Queue System maintains a list of outstanding analysis tasks in the database and is responsible for assigning tasks to analysis processes.

## Implementation
The system is implemented as two tables in the databse, `tasks` and `tasks-progress`, and the stored procedure `get-tasks()`.
