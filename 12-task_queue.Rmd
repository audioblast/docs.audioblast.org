# The Task Queue System
The Task Queue System maintains a list of outstanding analysis tasks in the database and is responsible for assigning tasks to analysis processes.

## Implementation
The system is implemented as two tables in the databse, `tasks` and `tasks-progress`, and the stored procedure `get-tasks()`.

### `tasks` table
The table `tasks` is a list of outstanding analysis tasks. It is populated automatically by triggers on the `recordings` and `recordings-calcuated` table. Analysis tasks are grouped into sections (recordings_calculated, sounscapes_minute and soundscpaes_second). The `recordings-calculaed` table has a TINYINT column for each of these, that is set to `1` once the task is completed.

### `tasks-progress` table
The table `tasks-progress` is populated by the stored procedure `get-tasks()` when an analysis process requests outstanding tasks. It is used to prevent the same task being analysed to multiple analysis processes. Tasks from an unresponsive process (e.g. a process which has crashed) can be reassigned after an hour of inactivity by that process.

### `get-tasks()` stored procedure
The stored procedure `get-tasks(process_id, n, source)` is used to assign `n` tasks to the analysis process `process_id`. It inserts `n` random unassigned tasks from the `tasks` table into the `tasks-progress` table along with the process_id and the current timestamp. It returns via a SELECT statement these tasks.

### `delete-task()` stored proecure
The stored procedure `delete-task(process_id, source, id, task)` marks a task as complete by deleting it from the `tasks` table. A trigger in the `tasks` table will delete the matching row from `tasks-progress`. The started time of any remaining tasks assigned to the same `process_id` in the `tasks-progess` table will be updated to the current time. A call is made to the stored procedure `_quickMaintain()` which will perform routine maintenance tasks, including removing any expired tasks in the `tasks-progress` table.
